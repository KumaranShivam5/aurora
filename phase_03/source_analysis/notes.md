# Data preparation

this phase is dedicated to creation of training data .
we need to collect information for each source ,
collect sources examples and their individual observations 
look for whether they are in outburst phase or not 

## Tasks
* Download chandra cross matched sources for different classes
* Use CIAO tools for per observation study 
* plot flux vs observation date for each source
* Mark source as good or bad (maybe some kind of weighting would be better)
